    <strong>Research Content: </strong>Signal Type Recognition Algorithm Based on Invariant Scattering Convolutional Network
    <br />
    Designed and implemented a modulation recognition algorithm based on the Invariant Scattering Convolution Network (ISCN), using scattering coefficients as feature inputs. The algorithm combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, sub-spectral normalization, and residual modules to enhance signal recognition accuracy. To mitigate noise interference, a wavelet threshold denoising step was integrated, significantly improving the stability and accuracy of signal recognition.
